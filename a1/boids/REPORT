CSC 418 - Assignment 1 Report File

In this file you must:

__________________________________________________________________
1) Describe *briefly* and *concisely* what parts of the assignment
   you found easier, harder, and/or tricky to get right

	Boid update (rule0-3) is easy to implement.
	Animation (shape update of a boid) is harder. Need to pay extra attention
	to the sequence of transformations. 
	Choosing nice colors also requirs a lot of experiments, which is time-comsuming.


__________________________________________________________________
2) Answer any //QUESTION: items noted in the code

 QUESTION:
  Is this the optimal way to implement this
 rule? can you see any problems or ways
 to improve this bit? (rule0)

	Different boid should have different weights according to its distance
	from the current boid, different sizes and roles (leaders).
	If there is predator, its mass should not be considered.

 QUESTION: Why add inertia at the end and
  not at the beginning?

	Inertia should not contain any components from velocity1-3 (from rule1-3).



__________________________________________________________________
3) Describe any //CRUNCHY: extensions you implemented

* Single Boid animation (jellyfish squishing).
* Add leaders. Nearby boids tend to move toward these leaders.
* Add trails to every boid to show its last few positions.
* Mouse click on screen in either z or x direction (rotate view to change the direction)
  to disturb the boids at this positon.

4) Briefly comment on the following:

a) What is the time complexity of the boid update (in big Oh notation),
   justify.
	O(n^2)
	For each boid ----- O(n)
		check on every other boid velocity and location ----- O(n)

	Total: O(n*n*constant) = O(n^2)

b) What could you do to make the update more efficient?

	Combine all 3 rules (1-3) into one for-loop, it can reduce the constant in big-Oh.

c) What is the greatest bottleneck of the program:

    Is it the boid update code?
    Or is it the boid display code?

	the boid display code

    Why is that? justify your answer.

	Hard to do sophisticated shape of boid and make the boid look nicer.
	Because it requires a lot of experiments of coloring and combining different
	polygons to find a nice-looking combination. It also requires math, like poler curves
	and linear algebra.

d) How would you adapt the idea behind Boids to swarms of running
   creatures (e.g. a herd of charging animals, an army of CGI
   monsters, a crowd of simulated humans walking). Think of the
   specific conditions you would need to add to the simulation
   that are different from your Boids implementation

	Constrain the 3rd coordinate (y) to be 0. So all boids stay in a plane. 
	Rule 0-3 still apply.
